# Automated International Payroll & Cross-border Payouts

NusaPay is designed to revolutionize international payroll and cross-border transfers by automating the entire process from end-to-end. Our system eliminates manual complexities and reliance on traditional intermediaries, ensuring unparalleled efficiency, speed, and transparency.

Here's an overview of how NusaPay works to transform digital assets into salaries that land directly in your employees' bank accounts worldwide:

1. Fund & Payroll Data Submission by Employer: The process begins when an employer sends digital assets like USDC along with their employees' payroll data to NusaPay's Payroll Smart Contract. This serves as an automated entry point, ready for further processing.
2. Seamless Cross-Chain Handling (if required): Behind the scenes, NusaPay is capable of managing and optimizing the transfer of digital assets across various blockchains (e.g., from Arbitrum to Base) using advanced interoperability technology like Chainlink CCIP. This ensures that funds are always available on the most efficient blockchain for local processing, without requiring manual intervention from the employer.
3. Automated Conversion to Local Currency Representation: Once the digital assets arrive at the correct smart contract, our system automatically converts them into a digital representation of the local currency (e.g., IDRX for Indonesian Rupiah) via a decentralized exchange (DEX). This process is entirely on-chain and transparent.
4. Direct Fiat Payout to Bank Accounts: The key to NusaPay's cross-border capability is its automated on-chain to off-chain bridge. The local currency Smart Contract (e.g., IDRX SC) communicates payment information to our specialized Backend/API. This backend then triggers a direct transfer of the corresponding local fiat amount (e.g., IDR) to the employee's bank account via local banking systems.
5. Salary Directly Received by Employees: The final outcome is the employee's salary arriving quickly and securely in their bank account, eliminating the delays and costs often associated with traditional international transfers.

With this architecture, NusaPay not only simplifies global payroll but also builds a robust foundation for other cross-border transactions, offering a solution that is modular, secure, and high-performing.
