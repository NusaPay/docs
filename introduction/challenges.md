# Challenges

## Challenges Faced by NusaPay

### Technological Complexity of Cross-Environment Integration (On-chain to Off-chain)

Developing a cross-border payment protocol capable of converting digital assets into fiat and directly disbursing them to local bank accounts in various countries involves highly intricate technical demands. NusaPay must ensure seamless interoperability between its smart contracts (on-chain) and traditional banking infrastructure (off-chain). This includes ensuring secure smart contract execution, reliable data validation from multiple sources (e.g., recipient bank account details), and high service availability for processing mass payroll payments. All of this requires ongoing engineering iteration, rigorous testing, and performance optimization.

### Multi-Currency and Multi-Jurisdictional Liquidity Management

Managing the liquidity required for converting digital assets into various local fiat currencies across different countries is a significant challenge. NusaPay must ensure synchronization between stablecoin availability, fiat conversion capabilities, and timely disbursement of funds to recipient bank accounts. Unlike single-currency platforms, NusaPay must coordinate asset movement and conversions among independent currencies in _real-time_ for mass payments, minimizing slippage and liquidity fragmentation across various payment corridors.

### Protocol Security and Cross-Border Payment Operational Risks

Operating in a decentralized financial ecosystem and being connected to traditional systems means exposure to various security threats. These include smart contract vulnerabilities, potential data manipulation (e.g., payroll recipient details), and operational risks related to transfer failures at any point in the cross-border transfer (e.g., a bank rejecting a transaction). NusaPay must maintain transaction integrity from USDT input to the final deposit into recipient bank accounts.

### Ecosystem Adoption and Bootstrapping Challenges for Enterprise Payments (Payroll)

Launching a cross-border payment solution for enterprise scale, such as international payroll, especially on an emerging network (if utilizing a new L2 like EduChain), introduces challenges in onboarding corporate users, building trust, and establishing a foundational role within the corporate payment ecosystem. As a core DeFi primitive, NusaPay must demonstrate tangible value early by driving payroll activity, attracting companies, and offering meaningful integrations with existing enterprise accounting and HR systems.
