## Problems NusaPay Solves

As a next-generation cross-border payment protocol, NusaPay is specifically designed to address various inherent challenges within international money transfers, particularly those arising from reliance on legacy systems, the complexities of integrating digital assets with local fiat currencies, and the need for mass payments (e.g., payroll) across multiple countries.

## Fragmented Liquidity & Limited Pathways for Mass Cross-Country Payments

### Problem:

Traditional remittance systems, and even some existing crypto-based solutions, often operate within isolated corridors with fragmented liquidity. This makes it difficult for companies to efficiently process payroll or mass transactions to numerous recipients in various countries. The manual process of transferring funds one by one to individual bank accounts across multiple jurisdictions is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors.

### NusaPay's Solution:

NusaPay addresses this by facilitating seamless cross-country and cross-currency liquidity access. By enabling direct conversion of USDT to specific local currencies (e.g., IDRX for Indonesia, and other equivalent local currency representations for various target countries) and direct deposit into local bank accounts, NusaPay empowers companies to conduct efficient mass payments to numerous employees worldwide from a single, unified platform, without the need to manage individual transfers across diverse banking systems.

## Slow, Costly, and Inefficient International Payroll Processes

### Problem:

Traditional cross-border payroll mechanisms involve multiple intermediaries, lengthy clearing processes, and high per-transaction fees. For companies with employees in various countries, this process can be extremely time-consuming and expensive, as each transfer may require separate steps for currency conversion, bank verification, and final deposit. These delays lead to employee dissatisfaction and significant operational burdens for companies.

### NusaPay's Solution:

NusaPay mitigates this through optimized and automated smart contract execution. The entire transaction cycle—from bulk USDT input, efficient _swap_ processes, token _burning_ according to the destination currency's representation, to _minting_ and final deposit into individual bank accounts—is executed efficiently _on-chain_. This drastically reduces the time and cost associated with international payroll, ensuring employees receive their funds promptly and freeing finance departments from significant manual workloads.

## Security Risks, Lack of Transparency, and Reliance on Centralized Intermediaries

### Problem:&#x20;

International payroll payments through traditional banks or remittance services involve significant reliance on centralized intermediaries, which can pose security risks (such as data breaches or fraud) and a lack of transparency regarding transaction status. If issues arise, tracing the source of errors or delays can be extremely difficult.

### NusaPay's Solution:

NusaPay implements a trustless execution model entirely governed by audited smart contracts. All protocol functions, from the input of employee data and bulk payment details to the transfer of funds within the system and the final deposit into respective accounts, are executed transparently and verifiably _on-chain_. This ensures that all cross-border operations are secure, censorship-resistant, and transparent, eliminating the need for vulnerable centralized intermediaries and providing companies with full visibility over every payroll transaction.

## Complexity in Managing Employee Data and Recurring Payments

### Problem:

Companies managing international payroll often face challenges in securely storing and managing employee bank account data across various countries. The process for making recurring payments each month can be highly cumbersome, requiring repetitive manual data entry or relying on unintegrated systems.

### NusaPay's Solution:

NusaPay provides a detailed and comprehensive transaction history for all payments, including payroll. This feature allows companies to monitor payment statuses accurately. More importantly, the ability to securely store recipient data (e.g., employee and their bank account details) and schedule recurring payments significantly simplifies the monthly international payroll process. This reduces administrative burden, minimizes errors, and ensures consistency in salary disbursements.

## Limited Adoption and Integration of Large-Scale Digital Cross-Border Payment Solutions

### Problem:

Despite their efficiency, many companies remain hesitant or lack easy tools to adopt blockchain-based payment solutions for international payroll. Challenges include integration with existing accounting systems, regulatory compliance across different countries, and ease of use for HR and finance departments

### NusaPay's Solution:

NusaPay is designed to overcome these adoption barriers by offering an intuitive user interface and a seamless experience suitable for enterprise-scale operations. As a "DeFi primitive" and an integratable payment layer, NusaPay makes it easy for companies to connect digital wallets, create mass payment "instances," and perform direct deposits into employee bank accounts across various jurisdictions. This fosters long-term utility and adoption by providing an accessible and efficient bridge between digital assets and traditional payroll systems.
