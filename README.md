**NusaPay is a cutting-edge cross-border payment protocol** developed to serve as a foundational decentralized finance (DeFi) primitive for global remittances. It facilitates seamless asset conversion and direct bank deposits across multiple international corridors through a unified, user-friendly platform, eliminating the need for centralized custodians or traditional bridging mechanisms that often incur high fees and delays.

This system ensures consistency and correctness in cross-border operations, enabling reliable financial interactions at scale, with efficient local currency conversions.
